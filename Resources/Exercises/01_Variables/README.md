# Variables

When you declare a variable or constant in a program, you must either specify its type or use the var keyword to let the compiler infer the type.  
After you declare a variable, you can't redeclare it with a new type, and you can't assign a value not compatible with its declared type.  
When you declare a constant, you must specify its type and value, and once you have defined it, the value cannot be mutated.
